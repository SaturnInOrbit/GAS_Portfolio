  Hi there! This little corner of the web holds five essays I wrote for my Gender and Society class—pieces that 
  started as assignments but ended up becoming something more personal. They look at how we talk about gender 
  in everything: from food vlogs and pop songs to Discord chats and school policies here in the Philippines.
              </p>
              <p>
  At first, I just wanted to “finish the requirement.” But the more I listened—to dialogue, lyrics, even my own 
  silence—the more I realized how much of who we are gets shaped by language. Not just in big declarations, but 
  in the small stuff: who gets to speak, how we express joy or doubt, and what kinds of identities our words 
  make room for (or leave out).
              </p>
              <p>
  I’m still figuring things out myself—about gender, about voice, about what it means to belong. But writing 
  these helped me pay closer attention. Maybe reading them will do the same for you.
              </p>

  Just take a look, and maybe find something that sticks.

              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                This discourse analysis examines a naturalistic interaction between Andrea and Isaac in their vlog titled 
                "EATING ONLY FILIPINO FOOD FOR 24 HOURS!!". The segment captures an unscripted, intimate exchange as the 
                couple samples a variety of Filipino dishes—from Tapsilog breakfast to Kare-kare and Sinigang. Their dialogue 
                offers a window into how gender is linguistically performed, how conversational control is negotiated, and how 
                relational power and politeness shape everyday talk in informal digital media.
              </p>

              </figure>

              <h3>Gender Expression Through Language Choices</h3>
              <p>
                Andrea's speech is rich in affective language and evaluative intensity. She frequently uses interjections 
                ("Oh my God"), hyperbolic praise ("This is so freaking good"), and rhetorical questions ("Why have I never 
                had garlic rice like this before?"). These features function not only to express personal delight but also 
                to construct a shared emotional experience with both Isaac and the audience. Her language aligns with patterns 
                often associated with feminine speech styles: prioritizing connection, expressivity, and inclusive enthusiasm 
                ("You guys need to try tapsilog!").
              </p>
              <p>
                Isaac, by contrast, adopts a more restrained and evaluative stance. His contributions are often grounded in 
                sensory observation or personal preference: "It's got like a sweet taste," or "I don't usually order soups 
                at restaurants." When expressing skepticism, he uses mitigation: "I wouldn't say it's not good, but it's 
                definitely not the best Filipino dish I've ever tried." This cautious phrasing reflects a tendency in 
                masculine-coded discourse to avoid overt negativity while preserving relational harmony.
              </p>

              <h3>Turn-Taking and Interactional Control</h3>
              <p>
                Andrea initiates nearly all topics—naming dishes, announcing transitions between meals, and prompting Isaac 
                to try new foods ("Let's try this one"). She holds the primary narrative role, consistent with her position 
                as co-creator of the vlog and its main narrator. Isaac rarely introduces new topics; instead, he responds to 
                her prompts with brief assessments or affirmations ("Yeah," "Mhm," "That's fire").
              </p>
              <p>
                There are minimal interruptions, and when overlaps occur—such as during the sinigang portion ("Can you stop 
                taking it? No, put it in the middle")—they serve pragmatic coordination rather than conversational dominance. 
                Andrea maintains discursive leadership without overtly silencing Isaac; he willingly follows her lead, 
                indicating a consensual distribution of roles.
              </p>

              <h3>Politeness Strategies and Stance-Taking</h3>
              <p>
                Both speakers consistently use positive politeness, reinforcing solidarity through shared enjoyment and mutual 
                validation. Andrea frequently seeks alignment: "Right?" "Did you really think it wasn't going to be good?" 
                Isaac reciprocates with agreement and light humor ("You're about to drink it all").
              </p>
              <p>
                However, their approaches to criticism differ. Andrea offers unreserved praise but avoids negative judgment. 
                Isaac, when faced with a less appealing dish (Kare-kare), carefully softens his critique with hedges and 
                indirect phrasing. This contrast suggests a gendered difference in comfort with expressing disapproval.
              </p>

              <h3>Power Relations and Relational Dynamics</h3>
              <p>
                Power in this interaction is not hierarchical but role-specific. Andrea wields narrative and agenda-setting 
                authority—she decides what to eat, when to film, and how to frame the experience. Isaac operates as a 
                responsive, supportive participant, offering reactions that validate her curation. Yet this is not 
                subordination; his contributions are valued, and his opinions are solicited.
              </p>
              <p>
                Notably, both speakers reference cultural and familial connections ("my grandma used to make this," "something 
                your Lola would make"), grounding their experience in shared intimacy rather than performance alone.
              </p>

              <h3>Interpretation: Gendered Communication in Contemporary Digital Contexts</h3>
              <p>
                This exchange challenges rigid binaries of gendered communication. Andrea embodies assertiveness typically 
                coded as masculine—she directs, evaluates, and owns her expertise—while simultaneously using affective, 
                rapport-building language coded as feminine. Isaac demonstrates emotional attunement and receptivity often 
                associated with feminine styles, even as his speech remains measured.
              </p>
              <p>
                The interaction reflects a negotiated, post-traditional gender dynamic common in digitally mediated, peer-based 
                relationships. Rather than reinforcing dominance, language here serves to co-construct intimacy, curiosity, 
                and cultural appreciation. In sum, gendered communication is not static but situated, relational, and 
                performative.

            </div>

            <div class="essay-body">
              <h3>Representation of Men, Women, and Gender Roles</h3>
              <p>
                The song "gigolo" by bbno$ features a male narrator who proudly identifies as a "certified gigolo," engaging 
                in romantic or sexual relationships primarily for material benefit. This portrayal inverts the familiar cultural 
                narrative in which women are depicted as "gold diggers" or financially dependent on men. Here, the man leverages 
                his physical appeal—described as "pretty boy"—to receive luxury items, travel, and financial support from implied 
                older or wealthier female partners.
              </p>
              <p>
                Women in the song are represented almost exclusively as affluent benefactors. They are shown funding the narrator's 
                lifestyle, such as putting him "on her tab" or gifting high-end watches. However, they lack individuality or 
                emotional depth; they exist solely as enablers of his consumption. There is no exploration of their desires, 
                motivations, or agency beyond their role in this transactional dynamic.
              </p>

              <h3>Stereotypes and Biases</h3>
              <p>
                The song both challenges and reproduces gendered stereotypes. It subverts the common "sugar baby" trope by placing 
                a young man in the role typically assigned to women receiving financial support in exchange for companionship. 
                This challenges the assumption that only women commodify intimacy for material gain.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, the lyrics perpetuate a hyper-materialistic view of relationships. Both men and women are reduced 
                to functional roles: men as sexual commodities, women as financial providers. Lines such as "Throw me in her will, 
                so I'm pickin' out her coffin" introduce a darkly humorous yet ethically ambiguous suggestion of manipulation and 
                emotional detachment.
              </p>

              <h3>Linguistic Cues and Framing</h3>
              <p>
                The lyrics use irony, braggadocio, and youth-oriented slang to present the gigolo lifestyle as aspirational and 
                entertaining. Phrases like "certified gigolo" and "pretty boy anthem" reframe a once-stigmatized identity as 
                trendy and self-empowered.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wealth is consistently glorified through metaphors such as "blue chips," "caviar off a strip," and "trust fund baby," 
                all of which celebrate excess without critical reflection. The use of nonstandard grammar ("He don't") and contemporary 
                slang creates a sense of casual authenticity, aligning the song with youth culture.
              </p>

              <h3>"Reinforcement or Challenge?" to Gender Norms</h3>
              <p>
                "gigolo" partially disrupts traditional gender norms by centering a man in a role historically coded as feminine. 
                It openly mocks rigid masculinity by celebrating vanity, luxury consumption, and emotional detachment as markers 
                of success.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the song ultimately reinforces a binary and commodified understanding of gender. Men are valued for their 
                bodies and sexual utility; women for their wealth and willingness to spend. Neither party is seen seeking authentic 
                emotional connection. While the track playfully inverts the "man as provider" expectation, it does so by adopting 
                the same objectifying logic historically used against women.
              </p>

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                "gigolo" presents a satirical, gender-flipped fantasy that prioritizes entertainment over social critique. It reflects 
                a cultural moment in which traditional roles are mocked and reversed, yet not meaningfully reimagined with greater 
                humanity, reciprocity, or equality. The result is a catchy, self-aware performance that challenges surface-level 
                norms while leaving deeper structures of commodification intact.

                This analysis examines a segment of asynchronous discourse extracted from a public-facing Discord server with 
                approximately 12,000 members. The server functions as a social and gaming-oriented community primarily composed 
                of Filipino youth aged 16 to 26. Discord was chosen as the observation site due to its widespread use among young

                The transcript analyzed spans 57 minutes and includes 42 messages from 16 distinct participants. No prompts or 
                interventions were introduced; the data reflects organic exchanges around personal desires, gaming references, 
                humor, and relational commentary. Gender was inferred based on linguistic markers such as kinship terms ("kuya"), 
                emotive phrasing, and politeness particles ("po").
              </p>

              <h3>Differences in Language Use Among Genders</h3>
              <p>
                Female participants consistently employed emotionally expressive language, vulnerability, and politeness strategies. 
                Sel's opening message, "Gusto ko na magpa tattoo kasi baka magalit mommy ko 😭," illustrates this pattern by combining 
                personal agency with familial concern and an emoji signaling distress. Female speakers also frequently used Tagalog 
                honorifics such as "po" and softened requests, aligning with established norms of relational harmony in Filipino 
                communicative culture.
              </p>
              <p>
                Male participants, by contrast, favored brevity, humor, and gaming-oriented phrasing. They engaged in playful ridicule 
                accompanied by exaggerated laughter ("WHAKAKAJSHHAHAJAAHA"). This reflects a tendency to manage social bonds through 
                jest rather than disclosure. Emoji use was rare among male speakers; instead, they relied on capitalization, slang, 
                and allusion to shared gaming experiences to signal affiliation.
              </p>

              <h3>Gender-Based Conflicts or Misunderstandings</h3>
              <p>
                No overt conflict emerged along gender lines, yet subtle asymmetries in emotional responsiveness were evident. When 
                Sel asked "Comfort mo nga ako :(," the conversation shifted toward humor and gaming rather than affective support, 
                suggesting that emotional appeals from women may not always receive the empathetic engagement they seek. In contrast, 
                when Jon expressed disillusionment about adult responsibilities, Sevi responded with validation and lighthearted 
                encouragement, reinforcing traditional caregiving dynamics even in digital settings.
              </p>

              <h3>The Role of Semi-Anonymity and Platform Affordances</h3>
              <p>
                Although Discord does not enforce real-name policies, the persistent use of usernames creates a sense of continuity 
                and accountability. This semi-identified environment encourages code-switching. Participants fluidly blend English, 
                Tagalog, and internet vernacular depending on audience and intent. Gender appears to influence this code-switching: 
                women more often adopt polite or "cute" registers when making requests, while men maintain a consistently casual tone.
              </p>

              <h3>Inclusivity and Exclusion in Digital Discourse</h3>
              <p>
                The discourse operates within a largely heteronormative and cisnormative framework, with no explicit references to 
                LGBTQIA+ identities or nonbinary language. While no exclusionary language was observed, the absence of gender-diverse 
                expression suggests limited representation in this particular space. Nevertheless, the environment remains socially 
                cohesive, with women actively initiating topics, though often conforming to culturally prescribed modes of femininity.
              </p>

              <h3>Key Insights</h3>
              <p>
                This observation reveals that gendered communication persists in digital Filipino youth spaces not through overt 
                rules but through culturally embedded linguistic habits. Discord's affordances recontextualize rather than erase 
                gender norms. Crucially, while role flexibility exists, responses often reinforce traditional dynamics. The findings 
                support broader scholarship indicating that digital platforms reproduce social structures even as they enable new 
                forms of expression.

              <p>
                In many Philippine classrooms, gender is not something that is openly negotiated—it is simply assumed. Students 
                wear uniforms according to the sex marked on their registration forms, answer to names that were never questioned, 
                and move through school life without ever being asked how they truly understand themselves. For some, this unspoken 
                certainty aligns with their inner sense of self. For others, it creates a quiet dissonance: not a crisis, not a 
                rejection, but a lingering uncertainty about whether the gender they live by is the one that fully fits.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Department of Education's Child Protection Policy (DepEd Order No. 40, s. 2012) prohibits gender-based 
                discrimination and commits to a safe, respectful learning environment. Yet it frames gender exclusively within a 
                binary structure and omits any reference to sexual orientation, gender identity, or expression (SOGIE). As a result, 
                students who do not experience their gender in straightforward terms find no explicit affirmation in the policy 
                that governs their daily school life.
              </p>
              <p>
                This gap manifests in subtle but cumulative ways. Teachers sort students by "boys" and "girls" without alternative 
                options. Attendance sheets list only legal names. Guidance sessions on self-identity revolve around moral behavior 
                rather than personal exploration. In such an environment, students learn that conformity is the price of peace. 
                There is no hostility, only silence—and silence, in the absence of inclusive language, becomes a form of exclusion.
              </p>
              <p>
                To address this, DepEd must revise its policy to explicitly include SOGIE protections and provide clear, practical 
                guidance for schools on gender inclusivity. This includes allowing students to use preferred names informally, 
                offering gender-neutral participation options in activities, and training educators to recognize that not all 
                gender-related distress is visible or vocal.
              </p>
              <p>
                A truly protective policy does not require students to declare their identity to deserve respect. It creates space 
                for those who are still wandering, still wondering, to exist without having to first explain themselves. In a system 
                that prides itself on "matatag, magalang, at mapagkumbaba" values, the least it can offer is the dignity of possibility.

              <p>
                Before this course, I saw gender in communication as a set of predictable patterns—something you could neatly 
                categorize based on who was speaking. Over time, through close readings of everyday conversations, media texts, 
                digital interactions, and institutional policies, that certainty dissolved. What emerged instead was a far more 
                complex picture: language doesn't just reflect gender but shapes it, negotiates it, and sometimes conceals it 
                behind the guise of neutrality.
              </p>
              <p>
                What struck me most was how often inclusion is assumed where it isn't actually practiced. In casual vlogs, in 
                song lyrics, in group chats among peers, and even in policies meant to protect students, gender was either 
                flattened into a binary or treated as irrelevant—precisely because it was never named. I came to see that silence 
                isn't neutrality; it's a form of erasure that privileges those who already fit comfortably within existing categories.
              </p>
              <p>
                While I'm still charting myself, still moving through the world without overt friction, this course made me realize 
                that my own quiet uncertainty about gender isn't a lack of clarity—it's a valid position in itself, one shared by 
                many who navigate identity without needing to declare it loudly.
              </p>
              <p>
                The task that stayed with me longest wasn't the one with the sharpest analysis, but the one that asked me to look 
                inward: how does all this relate to who I am, and what I'm building? As an IT student, I used to think design was 
                about aesthetics and function. But I understand it's also about ethics. Every form I code, every interface I structure, 
                every dropdown menu I create carries assumptions about who users are and who they're allowed to be.
              </p>
              <p>
                Language lives in those small choices. And if I've learned anything, it's that the most inclusive spaces aren't 
                those that demand answers, but those that make room for the questions.
              </p>
              <p>
                This journey didn't give me a label or a resolution. But it gave me something more useful: the ability to listen 
                more carefully to others, to language, and to the quiet, persistent voice within that's still figuring things out. 
                And in a world that often demands certainty, I've learned there's power in simply holding space for the not-yet-known.

              <p>
                Hi! I'm <strong>James Miro R. Orte</strong>—a 19-year-old BSIT student at Dalubhasaan ng Lungsod ng Lucena, 
                currently in my second year of college and trying to make sense of things one assignment at a time. This little 
                collection of essays you've just read? Yeah, it's for my Gender and Society subject—but it's also become 
                something more personal than I expected.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I first got into college, I thought, "I've done high school, how much harder could this be?" Turns out… 
                pretty hard. Not just in terms of workload, but in the quiet questions that start showing up when you're finally 
                on your own: Who am I? What do I believe? And yeah—what even is gender, really?
              </p>
              <p>
                Writing these pieces pushed me to look closer—at vlogs, songs, group chats, even DepEd policies—not just as 
                texts to analyze, but as mirrors of how we talk, relate, and sometimes hide. I still don't have all the answers 
                about my own identity. And that's okay. What matters is staying open-minded and kind—to myself and others.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of coding and cramming for IT quizzes, I'm the kind of person who believes college isn't just about 
                grades. It's about staying up way too late talking about nothing, learning to cook something other than instant 
                noodles, saying "no" when you're stretched too thin, and saying "hi" even when you're shy. It's messy, awkward, 
                and beautiful—and I'm just trying to show up for it as honestly as I can.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thanks for reading. I hope something here stuck with you—even for a moment.
              </p>
